# Overview

Expenses Now is a Java Desktop application written by Nicolas Pariente. It allows users to create an account and track their monthly expenses, receiving suggestions in the process.

The project was created as a learning exercise to understand Java by applying the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern using a desktop UI built with Swing. Data is stored in CSV files, simulating a lightweight database.

Through this project, I learned:

- How to install and configure the JDK
- How to use the NetBeans IDE and Swing components
- How to structure Java code using MVC
- How to implement event handling through interfaces
- How to use dynamic arrays (List)
- How to read and write data to/from CSV files

# Development Environment

- Java Version: JDK 17 (from Oracle)
- IDE: NetBeans
- Key Libraries:
  javax.swing – for the graphical user interface
  java.awt.event – to handle mouse and UI events
  java.util.List – to manage dynamic arrays
  java.time – for handling date-related operations

Note: The application should be executed from the root folder ExpensesNow.
