# Overview

Expenses Now is a software written in Java language by Nicolas Pariente. The program allows users to create an account, and track their monthly expenses receiving suggestions in the process.

The purpose of this software was to learn Java by apply the MVC model to a desktop app, including views, controllers and a model communicating in this case witha csv file.
I learned how to install the JDK, how Netbeans IDE features work with Swing, how to structure the Java code, how event interfaces can be implemented, how dynamic arrays work with Java, and how to read and write to a csv file.

# Development Environment

To develop the software I installed the JDK version 17 from Oracle website. I used Netbeans as the IDE.

Important libraries that are part of my Java project are "Swing" for the UI, "java.awt.event" to handle Mouse events, "java.util.List" to implement dynamic arrays, and "java.time" to add date calculations.

# Future Work

- Implement a Database to store user and expenses records with ID key, instead of a csv file.
- Add functionallity to edit and delete already created expenses records.
- Make the UI elements responsive.
